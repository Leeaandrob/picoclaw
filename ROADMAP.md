# PicoClaw Roadmap

> A lightweight, single-binary AI agent that runs anywhere — from cloud servers to Raspberry Pi Zero.

This document outlines the development roadmap for PicoClaw as an independent project. Our goal is to build the most capable, deployable, and extensible personal AI agent in the Go ecosystem.

---

## Current State

PicoClaw ships as a single Go binary with zero runtime dependencies. Today it includes:

- **27 tools** — file ops, shell, web search/fetch, messaging, image generation (DALL-E 3), TTS (OpenAI + ElevenLabs), per-agent memory (BM25 + vector search), cron scheduling, cross-agent sessions, device pairing, usage tracking, approval workflows, and more
- **14 messaging channels** — Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp (native + bridge), Feishu, DingTalk, LINE, QQ, OneBot, WeCom, MaixCam, Pico WebSocket
- **20+ LLM providers** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, Ollama, OpenRouter, Mistral, Qwen, and others via OpenAI-compatible HTTP + dedicated Anthropic adapter + CLI providers (Claude Code, Codex)
- **Multi-agent architecture** — agent registry, 7-level priority routing, spawn/subagent delegation, cross-agent session communication, model fallback chains with cooldown tracking
- **Infrastructure** — loop detection hooks, cron service, heartbeat, device event monitoring, skills marketplace integration, context caching (Anthropic + OpenAI)

---

## Design Principles

1. **Single binary, zero dependencies** — `scp picoclaw server:` and you're running
2. **Runs anywhere** — x86, ARM, RISC-V, from cloud VMs to embedded hardware
3. **MCP-native** — first-class Model Context Protocol support (not an afterthought)
4. **Extend in any language** — MCP servers replace language-locked plugin SDKs
5. **Minimal resource footprint** — ~20MB idle RAM, <100ms startup
6. **Embeddable** — use PicoClaw as a Go library in your own projects

## Phase 1 — Foundation

Core capabilities that unlock real-world usage.

### Inbound Vision / Multimodal

Complete the media pipeline so images sent via messaging channels reach the LLM as multimodal content.

- [ ] Wire `InboundMessage.Media` files through to `ContentParts` on user messages
- [ ] Base64 encoding with MIME detection for HTTP providers (OpenAI/Gemini format)
- [ ] Anthropic-native image blocks (`NewImageBlockBase64`)
- [ ] Telegram photo/document lifecycle (stop premature cleanup)
- [ ] CLI provider fallback (save image, reference path in prompt text)

### MCP Server

Expose PicoClaw's tools and agent capabilities via the Model Context Protocol.

- [ ] stdio transport (for IDE integrations — VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code)
- [ ] HTTP+SSE transport (for network clients)
- [ ] All registered tools exposed as MCP tools
- [ ] Agent sessions exposed as MCP resources
- [ ] Prompt templates for common workflows

### MCP Client

Consume external MCP servers to extend PicoClaw's capabilities without writing Go code.

- [ ] stdio transport (launch local MCP server processes)
- [ ] HTTP+SSE transport (connect to remote MCP servers)
- [ ] Dynamic tool discovery and registration
- [ ] Per-agent MCP server configuration
- [ ] Graceful lifecycle management (start/stop/restart)

### Quick Wins

- [ ] Wire `EnrichMessageWithLinks` into the message processing pipeline
- [ ] Register `BlackboardTool` and `HandoffTool` from the multiagent package
- [ ] Wire auth rotation into the provider factory (round-robin multi-key with cooldown)
- [ ] Add Edge TTS provider (free, no API key required)

---

## Phase 2 — Differentiation

Features that set PicoClaw apart through Go's strengths.

### Browser Automation (CDP Native)

Direct Chrome DevTools Protocol integration — no Playwright, no Node.js, no external dependencies.

- [ ] CDP WebSocket client in pure Go
- [ ] Core actions: navigate, click, type, screenshot, evaluate JS
- [ ] AI-optimized page snapshots (accessibility tree extraction)
- [ ] Tab management and multi-profile support
- [ ] Optional Chrome Extension relay for user's live tabs

### Speech-to-Text

Multi-provider STT so voice messages from Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord are transcribed and understood.

- [ ] OpenAI Whisper API
- [ ] Groq Whisper (fast, free tier)
- [ ] Deepgram
- [ ] Provider fallback chain (reuse existing `FallbackChain` pattern)

### Memory Upgrade

Migrate from JSON-file persistence to SQLite for production-grade memory.

- [ ] SQLite storage via `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure Go, no CGO)
- [ ] sqlite-vec for vector similarity search
- [ ] FTS5 full-text search (replaces custom BM25)
- [ ] MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance) for result diversity
- [ ] Temporal decay scoring
- [ ] Session transcript indexing with incremental delta sync

### Subagent Management

Full lifecycle control for spawned subagents.

- [ ] `subagents` tool: list, kill, steer running subagents
- [ ] Depth limits to prevent infinite recursion
- [ ] Thread-binding (subagent replies go to specific channel thread)
- [ ] Timeout and cleanup policies

### Security Hardening

- [ ] SSRF protection on `web_fetch` (block internal IP ranges)
- [ ] Docker sandbox for `exec` tool (optional, opt-in)
- [ ] Audit logging for tool executions
- [ ] Workspace-only file access guards (configurable per agent)

---

## Phase 3 — Surpass

Capabilities that go beyond what existing AI agent platforms offer.

### MCP Hub

PicoClaw as a universal MCP bridge — expose all tools via MCP while consuming external MCP servers.

- [ ] Bidirectional MCP: server + client simultaneously
- [ ] Tool namespace management (avoid collisions between MCP sources)
- [ ] MCP server health monitoring and auto-reconnect
- [ ] Config-driven MCP server declarations

### Plugin Architecture via MCP

Replace traditional language-locked plugin SDKs with MCP servers in any language.

- [ ] Python MCP servers for data science tools
- [ ] JavaScript/TypeScript MCP servers for web tooling
- [ ] Rust MCP servers for performance-critical operations
- [ ] Plugin marketplace discovery and installation

### WebAssembly Plugin Runtime

Sandboxed, polyglot tool execution via Wasm.

- [ ] [wazero](https://github.com/tetragonix/wazero) integration (pure Go Wasm runtime, zero CGO)
- [ ] WASI support for filesystem and network access
- [ ] Tool hot-loading without agent restart
- [ ] Resource limits (memory, CPU time) per plugin

### Streaming Voice Pipeline

Real-time STT to Agent to TTS pipeline leveraging Go's concurrency model.

- [ ] Goroutine-based audio pipeline (parallel STT + LLM + TTS)
- [ ] WebSocket audio streaming for web clients
- [ ] VAD (Voice Activity Detection) for natural turn-taking
- [ ] Telephony integration (SIP/WebRTC)

### Embedded Mode

Use PicoClaw as a Go library — import it into your own applications.

- [ ] Clean public API surface (`picoclaw.New()`, `agent.Chat()`, `tools.Register()`)
- [ ] No global state, fully injectable dependencies
- [ ] Example: embed PicoClaw in a Go web server
- [ ] Example: embed PicoClaw in a CLI tool

### Observability

Production-grade monitoring and metrics.

- [ ] Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)
- [ ] OpenTelemetry traces for tool executions and LLM calls
- [ ] Structured JSON logging (already partially implemented)
- [ ] Health check endpoints with dependency status

## Contributing

We welcome contributions at any phase of the roadmap. If you're interested in working on a specific item:

1. Open an issue to discuss the approach
2. Reference this roadmap in your PR description
3. Follow existing patterns in the codebase (see `pkg/tools/` for tool examples, `pkg/channels/` for channel examples)

Priority areas where help is most needed:

- **MCP implementation** (Phase 1) — the highest-impact differentiator
- **Browser CDP** (Phase 2) — pure Go CDP client
- **New channels** (Phase 4) — each channel is relatively self-contained
- **Testing** — improving coverage across all packages
